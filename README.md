wordpress-compose
======================
Deploy a Wordpress + MySQL setup with persistent data using [rexray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray) with a single command

## Description
This docker-compose file will bring up a Wordpress + MySQL pair on a single host. Utilizing [rexray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray) we can persist that data across multiple hosts that is compatible on multiple storage platforms. (Future version will use Docker Machine & libNetwork to have the containers spread across hosts)

## Requirements
* [rexray](https://github.com/emccode/rexray) (as of v0.1.150807) requires CentOS7. This was completed using [AWS ami-96a818fe](http://thecloudmarket.com/image/ami-96a818fe--centos-7-x86-64-2014-09-29-ebs-hvm-b7ee8a69-ee97-4a49-9e68-afaee216db2e-ami-d2a117ba-2)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on the CentOS 7 hosts. Use `1.4.0` or later [Docker Compose Releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/installation/centos/) v 1.8+ installed on the CentOS 7 hosts.

## Installation
Provision 2+ CentOS 7 hosts and issue the following commands on each:
```
$ sudo su
# yum update -y
# yum install numactl libaio wget -y
# curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
# service docker start
# chkconfig docker on
# wget -nv https://github.com/emccode/rexraycli/releases/download/latest/rexray-Linux-x86_64 -O /bin/rexray
# chmod +x /bin/rexray
# wget -nv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emccode/rexray/master/rexray/rexray.service -O /usr/lib/systemd/system/rexray.service

//change your Environment Variables depending upon your storage system. Consult the rexray documenation to learn more
# echo 'AWS_SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey' >> /etc/environment
# echo 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY=myaccesskey' >> /etc/environment

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart rexray.service
# exit
$ sudo su
```

At this point you should be able to do a `docker info` to see Docker information and `rexray get-instance` that shows what storage platforms are available to rexray.

```

Install the latest version of [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases) (must be 1.4+) on each CentOS 7 machine
```
# curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.4.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /bin/docker-compose
# chmod +x /bin/docker-compose
```

## Provision Volumes for Persistent Data
The data that will persist between containers that are destroyed and created must live on the storage platform. Using rexray, we will create two new volumes to store MySQL and Wordpress data. Each of these volumes is 20GB in size. You can size them however you want and depending on the platform (EBS in this case) you can specify the backing type and IOPS needed. The most important variable is the name given to the volume because that must be passed to the `docker run...` command.
```
# rexray new-volume --size=20 --volumename="wpdata"
# rexray new-volume --size=20 --iops=300 --volumetype="ssd" --volumename="mysqldata"
```

## Start Containers with Docker Compose
We will grab this `docker-compose.yml` file to bring up the containers on the same host.
```
# curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kacole2/wordpress-compose/master/docker-compose.yml > /wordpress-compose/docker-compose.yml
# cd /wordpress-compose
# docker-compose up
```

## Start Containers Manually
If you don't want to use Docker Compose, you can start the containers manually with:
```
# docker run -d --name wpmysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="87654321" --volume-driver=rexray -v mysqldata:/var/lib/mysql mysql:latest

# docker run --name wordpress --link wpmysql:mysql -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD="87654321" -p 8080:80 --volume-driver=rexray -v wpdata:/var/www/html -d wordpress
```
